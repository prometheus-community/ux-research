# Background & Motivation

Prometheus has always prioritized solving complex technical challenges to deliver a reliable, performant open-source monitoring system. Over time, however, users have expressed a variety of experience-related pain points—ranging from onboarding and configuration to documentation, mental models, and interoperability across the ecosystem.

[At PromCon 2025, a user research was presented](https://www.youtube.com/live/SzSUa5y7Ji0?si=E5SA9vCmg5hQGz3u&t=13178) that highlighted several of these issues. Although the central area of investigation involved Prometheus ↔ OpenTelemetry workflows, the broader takeaway was clear: Prometheus would benefit from a dedicated, ongoing effort to understand user needs and improve the overall user experience.

Recognizing this, the Prometheus team established a Working Group focused on improving user experience through design and user research. This group is meant to support all areas of Prometheus by bringing structured research, user insights, and usability perspectives into the community’s development and decision-making processes—not just in relation to any single integration or technology.

# Mission
Contribute to making Prometheus the best observability tool for metrics for its end users by identifying their needs, pain points, and providing actionable insights to the community.

# Scope
The UX Working Group will:
* Conduct research to understand user expectations, workflows, and challenges across the entire Prometheus ecosystem.
* Identify and communicate what changes (technical or non-technical) are needed to improve the Prometheus user experience.


The WG’s role is to inform and guide, not to implement solutions directly.

# Goals
* Identify user pain points across the Prometheus ecosystem.

* Help the community understand what “best-in-class user experience” looks like for a monitoring system.

* Provide clear, accessible information about user needs and expectations.

* Support maintainers and contributors with research-backed recommendations.

* Encourage broader engagement with user-focused topics across the community, including participation in community forums and summits.



# Non-Goals
The following are not responsibilities of the UX Working Group:
* Writing or maintaining Prometheus code.

* Marketing or promoting Prometheus.

* Making final decisions on technical or strategic direction.
  * We provide input, not final authority.

* Controlling how—or whether—our research is implemented.

* Project managing technical work resulting from the research.


As the WG evolves, responsibilities may be revisited based on community needs.

# Values & Principles
We commit to:
* Ethical Research
  * Protecting user data and respecting privacy.

* Being honest and transparent in our findings.
  * Using data to inform and validate—not to confirm preconceived opinions.

* Inclusive Contribution
  * Creating a welcoming space for designers, researchers, developers; both regular and first-time contributors.

* Encouraging diverse perspectives and community participation.

* Open Collaboration
  * Conducting our work in public whenever possible.

* Sharing progress, findings, and artifacts openly.



# How we work
### Collaboration
* We support each other’s growth and learning.
* We default to openness by sharing drafts, ideas, and work in public channels.


### Meetings
* Biweekly meetings.
  * Current schedule: Wednesdays at 14:00 UTC (subject to change depending on contributor availability).


### Async-First Communication
* We prioritize asynchronous updates so progress is not dependent on meetings.
  * Contributors should feel empowered to propose topics, share findings, or start discussions at any time.


### Communication Channels
* [#prometheus-ux-wg](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09NL3B1EKW)

# Deliverables
The WG may produce:
* User research reports and summaries
* User journeys, personas, wireframes, prototypes, and other UX artifacts
* Recommendations for improving usability, onboarding, interoperability, and documentation
* Prioritized lists of user pain points
* Suggestions for community discussions or decision-making topics

Deliverables are shared with the community via:
* Slack
* Community meetings
* Conference talks
* Community events
