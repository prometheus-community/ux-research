# Interview Notes
We conducted interviews with key stakeholders and end users. This file contain summaries of these conversations and a link to the recordings.
## 👥 Stakeholder Interviews
We interviewed six stakeholders from both the OpenTelemetry and Prometheus communities. The goal was to:
- understand the historical context of their interoperability
- assess any past or ongoing adjustments to promote integration
- gauge openness to future changes based on UX research insights
- identify key interoperability challenges from their perspective
