That child collector forwards to our OTel gateway collector which only has the OTLP receiver. It's a bit awkward configuring the scrape configs and deciding where to do relabeling between the scrape configs or processors, and whether the processing should happen on the gateway for attribute consistency across a bunch of different signals and collectors. OTel native receivers and the k8s attribute processor default to setting attributes like k8s.cluster.name. Whereas the prom label defaults coming in from scraping Kube state metrics default to cluster. We often stumble across label redundancies or inconsistencies depending on what the source of the metric is.","Converting between dot notation and snake, is pretty awkward. Particularly because we use Grafana Cloud as our backend provider and they have additional quirks in their ingestion pipelines. It can be hard to figure out from ingested labels what the attributes actually are to try and configure processors like transfrom processors or filters.","We almost always use kubernetes and service resource attributes in our queries.

I use identifying attributes much like job and instance or other identifying labels are used in Prometheus - to find instances of something, to label-match when associating different series, etc. I generally want these on every time-series, much like {job,instance}.

I use non-identifying resource attributes for informational purposes like determining the version of something. I do _not_ want this on every metric.

There are also secondary identifying attributes, which are not necessary to ensure uniqueness of a resource, but help find instances of it. These can be things like parent resource identifiers for if I want to find all resources in a certain category or parent etc.","Mapping them to labels is absolutely painful. Prometheus already has such severe problems with TSDB index bloat, exploding and unmanageable memory use in queries, etc that the label proliferation from them makes it nearly unusable at any scale right now. Especially if the resource attributes are not fully under my control.

I generally have to use an intermediate OpenTelemetry Collector to filter and proxy the data so I can feed Prometheus a minimal subset to limit the blast radius.",
